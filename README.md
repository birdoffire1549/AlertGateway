# AlertGateway
This is a REST Service which allows network devices to easily send alerts to email recipients via the Internet.

This service uses SpringBoot to publish various REST endpoints. Communication with these REST endpoints are done primarily using JSON. 

## Please Note:
This project is currently a work-in-progress. Even so, its basic functionality has been tested locally on my development machine and deemed to have the desired basic functionality in place and working.
